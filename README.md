# Ride-Pooling with Eclipse MOSAIC

On-demand ride-pooling is emerging as an innovative mobility alternative to existing transportation modes. It offers greater flexibility than public transportation by operating without fixed routes or schedules, provides the convenience of door-to-door service, and is more affordable than owning a private vehicle, taking a taxi, or using ride-hailing services, as it allows users to share rides.

While ride-hailing has gained significant popularity in recent decades, its low occupancy rates and high number of empty miles contribute to increased congestion and emissions. With accelerating global population growth and urbanization, these challenges become more critical. Ride-pooling presents a promising alternative that combines the advantages of both worlds, ultimately helping to reduce traffic congestion and reduce emissions.

This project presents heuristics and metaheuristics as the optimal balance between computational speed and solution quality for ride-pooling problems. A centralized architecture is proposed, integrating multiple heuristics for assignment, rebalancing, and fleet management, rather than relying on a single heuristic. The architecture is implemented as an application within the Eclipse MOSAIC simulation framework. A key contribution is the deployment of ride-pooling in the city-wide BeST scenario, which simulates Berlin's urban traffic for a realistic evaluation. Simulation results show that ride-pooling achieves waiting times comparable to ride-hailing while maintaining negligible detour times. From an operational perspective, it reduces total mileage, improves service rates, and enhances overall system efficiency, demonstrating its feasibility as an alternative to taxis, ride-hailing, and public transportation. Future research could explore machine learning techniques for fleet rebalancing and decentralized strategies for electric vehicle fleets.
